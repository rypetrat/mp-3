          <p> 
              About myself, I am an undergraduate pursuing a BA in Computer Science at Boston University. As a fresh new 
              mind eager to apply my abilities, I am eager for exciting and challenging opportunities to learn and grow personally and 
              professionally. Where I currently lack in professional experience, I possess and have honed educational knowledge in required, 
              practical and advanced skills to excel and succeed working as an individual contributor or with others in a workplace team 
              environment. The engineering skills I possess are broad and effective to be a reliable contributor to a team looking for 
              knowledge and practical experience in effective engineering and testing abilities, proven problem-solving skills 
              conscientious about deploying error free solutions quickly with a keen ability to find and fix bugs when they occur. 
              I'm told I am an enthusiastic person who listens well and considers all sides of an issue to build a consensus to achieve 
              both short- and long-term objectives. All while I'm a happy and positive person with a relaxed demeanor and a strong 
              willingness to help everyone whenever they ask or seem in need of assistance.
